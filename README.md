Current and foreseeable advancements and availability of genotyping and phenotyping technologies will
further decrease the cost of genotyping and phenotyping, hence the employment of many individual plants
for GWAS will become feasible (Romay et al., 2013; Tibbs Cortes et al., 2021). Investigating strategies
for optimizing individual plant GWAS is necessary to fully capitalize on these, as it eliminates the costly
production and maintenance of inbred line association panels. This study expanded IP-GWAS by
investigating Haplotype-based compared to SNP-based GWAS using the phenotype and genotype data of
individual plants from diverse European maize landrace populations (EMLP). Such a highly diverse
material was chosen to overcome the limitations posed by population-specific QTLs and to evaluate the
effectiveness of the two IP-GWAS methods in capturing genes and loci controlling plant height, grain
yield, ear weight, leaf length, and leaf width.
